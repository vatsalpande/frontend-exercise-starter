# eBay React Coding Exercise — Listings Manager

Thank you for your interest in joining the **eBay Engineering Team**.  
This repository contains a coding exercise used in our recruitment process for frontend engineering roles.

Please complete the exercise below, upload your code to a **personal GitHub repository**, and share the link with us.  

⚠️ **Important:** Please **do not fork this repository**. Forks on GitHub are public and may expose your solution to other candidates.  
Instead, download or clone the repo locally, then push your solution to a new repository in your own account.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js v22.x** (repo ships with `.nvmrc`, run `nvm use`)  
- **Yarn**

---

## Getting Started

~~~bash
nvm use
yarn install
# one-time setup for MSW
npx msw init public --save
yarn dev
~~~

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

> Note: Navigating directly to `/products?...` in the address bar will return the SPA’s HTML.  
> Use DevTools → Network → Fetch/XHR (or `fetch('/products')` in the console) to view the mocked JSON responses.

## 📌 Coding Exercise

You will build a small **Listings Manager** for products (think simple marketplace admin).  
A minimal API is mocked using **MSW** so the app runs offline and tests are deterministic.

The list and toolbar are intentionally unimplemented. Build the structure and styling you think is appropriate.

When the starter runs, you’ll see placeholder notes on the Products and Details pages. Replace them as you implement the UI and data flow.


### Timebox

Please spend **no more than 3–4 hours** on this exercise.  
Focus on the **core requirements first**. We are more interested in how you approach the problem than in feature completeness.  

Completing all core requirements is considered a strong submission.

### 🎯 Core Requirements

- **Product List**
  - Display a **paginated list** of products.
  - Each product shows: name, price, category, and stock status.
  - Sorting (by price, name, etc.)
- **Product Details**
  - Allow users to view details of a product on a separate route (or modal).
- **Search & Filter**
  - Provide search by product name.
  - Allow filtering by category.
- **States**
  - Handle loading, empty, and error states gracefully.
- **Accessibility**
  - Implement search, filter, and pagination controls with accessible markup (labels, roles, keyboard navigation).

👉 The structure for the toolbar (search, filter, sort) is **intentionally not provided** — please design and implement this yourself (you may use component libraries).

---

## 🔗 API (Mocked with MSW)

The mock server provides these endpoints:

- `GET /products?query=&category=&page=1&limit=10`  
- `GET /products/:id`  

Seed data is in `src/mocks/data/products.json`.  
You can adjust mock behavior in `src/mocks/handlers.ts`.

---

## ✅ What We Evaluate

- **Code quality & structure** — components, hooks, state management, TypeScript hygiene  
- **UX & product thinking** — sensible defaults, empty/loading/error states, responsiveness, accessibility  
- **UI skills** — how you design and implement the search/filter/sorting controls without a prebuilt scaffold  
- **Testing** — provide at least a couple of meaningful tests that demonstrate your testing approach  
- **Communication** — notes in your README about design decisions, trade-offs, and what you’d do with more time  

---

## 📤 Submission Instructions

1. Complete the exercise.  
2. Push your solution to a **personal GitHub repo** (do not fork this one).  
3. Share the repository link with us.
